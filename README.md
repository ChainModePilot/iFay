iFay (Intellect Fay) is a digital co-brain for humans. It fuses human cognition with AI computing power to deliver proactive prediction services. Instead of requiring users to manually operate external applications, APIs, MCPs, or hardware, iFay takes over execution.

üéØ Goal

Our mission is to establish a shared standard for creating AI avatars. Every avatar must meet the following requirements:
1.	Replicate the personality of its human host
2.	Proactively reason and provide services based on context
3.	Be recognizable by other humans or iFay instances
4.	Interact and collaborate with other humans or iFay instances
5.	Take over and safeguard the human host‚Äôs privacy, including long-term memory
