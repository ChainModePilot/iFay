iFay (Individual Fay) is an AI avatar that integrates the user's human personality and digital capabilities. 

In the foreseeable future, it is evident that most jobs requiring knowledge, experience, and skilled operations can be accomplished by AI and robots. Even some trivial daily tasks in life can be entrusted to them.

Therefore, we are committed to creating a digital avatar that is highly aligned with an individual human's values, preferences, and habits. It can independently handle tasks and solve problems in the host's style, and only interacts briefly with the host when delivering results or when situations are ambiguous.

üéØ Goal

Our mission is to establish a shared standard for creating AI avatars. Every avatar must meet the following requirements:
1.	Replicate the personality of its human host
2.	Proactively reason and provide services based on context
3.	Be recognizable by other humans or iFay instances
4.	Interact and collaborate with other humans or iFay instances
5.	Take over and safeguard the human host‚Äôs privacy, including long-term memory
