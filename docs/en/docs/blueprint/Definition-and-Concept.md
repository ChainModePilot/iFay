### GMChain
**Global Merit Chain**, a blockchain where digital tokens are obtained by measuring recognizable social contribution. Unlike most blockchain projects, this project relies entirely on the recognition of social value to obtain tokens, rather than through completing predefined and undisputed computational tasks within the project. At the same time, in order to connect with the value recognition methods in the real world, it also accepts targeted issuance methods mortgaged by fiat currencies, bonds, asset certificates, gold, etc.

### MeriToken
Digital tokens, a type of quantitative digital credential corresponding to the degree of social contribution.

### μ (MU)
Merit Unit, the unit of MeiToken.
